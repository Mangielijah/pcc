        GOD, who made the earth,\n
The air, the sky, the sea,\n
Who gave the light its birth,\n
 Careth for me.\n
            \n
God, who made the grass,\n
The flower, the fruit, the tree,\n
The day and night to pass,\n
 Careth for me.\n
            \n
God, who made the sun,\n
            The moon, the stars, is He\n
Who, when life’s clouds come on,\n
 Careth for me.\n

God, who made all things\n
 On earth, in air, in sea,\n
Who changing seasons brings\n
 Careth for me.\n

God, who sent His Son\n
 To die on Calvary,\n
He, if I lean on Him,\n
 Will care for me.\n

        O TRINITY, O blessèd light,\n
O unity, most principal,\n
The fiery sun now leaves our\n
            sight: Cause in our hearts\n
            Thy beams to fall.\n

Let us with songs of\n

 At morn and evening Thee\n
 implore,\n
And let our glory, bowed to Thine,\n
 Thee glorify for evermore.\n

To God the Father, glory great,\n
And glory to His only son,\n
And to the Holy paraclete,\n
Both now and still while ages\n
run. Amen.\n

O God;\n
Thy sovereign power we sound\n
 abroad;\n
All nations bow before Thy throne\n
 And Thee the great Jehovah own.\n

Loud hallelujahs to Thy Name\n
 Angels and seraphim proclaim;\n
By all the powers and thrones in\n
 heaven\n
Eternal praise to Thee is given.\n

 Thou God of hosts, by all\n

            ROUND the Lord in glory seated,\n
Cherubim and seraphim\n
Filled His temple, and repeated\n
 Each to each the alternate hymn:\n
‘Lord, Thy glory fills the heaven;\n
 Earth is with its fulness stored;\n
Unto Thee be glory given,\n
 Holy, holy, holy Lord.’\n\n
Heaven is still with glory ringing,\n
 Earth takes up the angels’ cry,\n
‘Holy, holy, holy,’ singing,\n
 ‘Lord of hosts, the Lord most\n
 high.\n
Lord, Thy glory fills the heaven;\n
 Earth is with its fulness stored;\n
Unto Thee be glory given,\n
 Holy, holy, holy Lord.’\n\n
With His seraph train before Him,\n
 With His holy Church below,\n
Thus conspire we to adore Him,\n
Bid we thus our anthem flow;\n
‘Lord, Thy glory fills the heaven;\n
 Earth is with its fulness stored;\n
Unto Thee be glory given,\n
 Holy, holy, holy Lord.’\n

A GLADSOME hymn of praise\n
we sing\n
 And thankfully we gather\n
To bless the love of God above,\n
 Our everlasting Father.\n\n
In Him rejoice with heart and voice,\n
 Whose glory fadeth never,\n
Whose providence is our defence,\n
 Who lives and loves for ever.\n\n
Full in His sight His children stand,\n
 By His strong arm defended,\n
 And He whose wisdom guides the\n
 World\n
 Our footsteps hath attended.\n\n
For nothing falls unknown to Him,\n
 Or care or joy or sorrow,\n
And He whose mercy ruled the past\n
 Will be our stay to-morrow.\n\n
Then praise the Lord with one\n
 accord,\n
 To His great Name give glory,\n
 And of His never-changing love\n
 Repeat the wondrous story.\n

ALL creatures of our God and\n
King,\n

 bright,\n

 light.\n\n

 day\n
 Unfoldest blessings on our way,\n
O praise Him, Alleluia!\n
The flowers and fruits that in\n
 thee grow,\n

 Forgiving others, take your part,\n

 trod.\n\n

ANGEL voices, ever singing\n
Round Thy throne of light,\n
Angel harps, forever ringing,\n
 Rest not day nor night;\n
Thousands only live to bless Thee,\n
 And confess Thee\n
Lord of might.\n\n
Yea, we know that Thou rejoicest\n
 O’er each work of Thine;\n
Thou didst ears and hands and\n
 voices\n
 For Thy praise design;\n
Craftsman’s art and music’s measure\n
 For Thy pleasure\n
All combine.\n\n
In Thy house, great God, we offer\n
 Of Thine own to Thee,\n
And for Thine acceptance proffer,\n
 All unworthily,\n
Hearts and minds and hands and\n
 voices,\n
 In our choicest Psalmody.\n\n
Honour, glory, might, and merit\n
 Thine shall ever be,\n
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit\n
 Blessèd Trinity.\n
Of the best that thou hast given,\n
 Earth and heaven\n
Render Thee.\n

BEAUTIFUL the fields beyond the\n
river!\n
Glorious the thousands gathered\n
 there!\n
 But who in heav’n, so full of\n
grace and glory Who with \n
Him, our Saviour, can compare? …\n
 Oh, He is the chief among ten\n
thousand! . . .\n
 Roll His praise in joyful waves\n
 along! . . .\n
For “altogether, altogether lovely!”\n
 Shall for ever be our happy song! . . .\n\n
Altogether, altogether lovely!\n
 He is calling tenderly to thee;\n
My soul, why not accept His great\n
 salvation,\n
 Offered now so rich, so full, so\n
 free?\n\n
Altogether, altogether lovely!\n
 Hear His voice – how tender\n
 still the call:\n
 “Come, come, ye weary ones and\n
 heavy-laden,\n
 Come to Me, and let your\n
 burdens fall!” . . .\n

GOD moves in a mysterious way,\n
 His wonders to perform ;\n
He plants His footsteps in the sea,\n
 And rides upon the storm.\n\n
Deep in unfathomable mines\n
 Of never-failing skill\n
He treasures up His bright designs,\n
 And works His sovereign will.\n\n
Ye fearful saints, fresh courage\n
 take;\n
 The clouds ye so much dread\n
Are big with mercy, and shall break\n
 In blessings on your head.\n\n
Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,\n
 But trust Him for His grace ;\n
Behind a frowning providence\n
 He hides a smiling face.\n\n
His purposes will ripen fast,\n
 Unfolding every hour;\n
The bud may have a bitter taste,\n
 But sweet will be the flower.\n
Blind unbelief is sure to err,\n
 And scan His work in vain ;\n
God is His own interpreter,\n
 And He will make it plain.\n

“GREAT is Thy faithfulness,” O\n
God my Father,\n
 There is no shadow of turning\n
 with Thee;\n
\n
 Thou changest not, Thy compas-\n
 sions, they fail not;\n
 As Thou hast been Thou for ever\n
 wilt be:\n
“Great is Thy faithfulness! Great is Thy\n
 faithfulness!”\n
 Morning by morning new mercies I see;\n
All I have needed Thy hand has provided.-\n
“Great is Thy faithfulness,” Lord, unto me.\n\n
 Summer and winter, and spring-\n
 time and harvest,\n
 Sun, moon and stars in their\n
 courses above,\n
Join with all nature in manifold\n
 witness\n
 To Thy great faithfulness,\n
 mercy and love:\n\n
Pardon for sin and a peace that\n
 endureth,\n
 Thy own dear presence to cheer\n
 and to guide;\n
Strength for today and bright hope\n
 for tomorrow,\n
 Blessings all mine, with ten\n
 thousand beside!\n

IMMORTAL, invisible, God only\n
 wise,\n
In light inaccessible hid from our eyes\n
 Most blessèd, most glorious,\n
 the Ancient of Days,\n
Almighty, victorious, Thy great\n
 Name we praise.\n\n
Unresting, unhasting, and silent as\n
 light,\n
 Nor wanting, nor wasting,\n
 Thou rulest in might;\n
Thy justice like mountains high\n
 soaring above\n
 Thy clouds which are fountains\n
 of goodness and love.\n\n
To all, life Thou givest – to both\n
 great and small;\n
 In all life Thou livest, the true\n
 life of all;\n
We blossom and flourish as leaves\n
 on the tree,\n
 And wither and perish – but\n
 nought changeth Thee.\n\n
Great Father of Glory, pure Father\n
 of Light,\n
 Thine angels adore Thee, all\n
 veiling their sight;\n
All laud we would render: O help\n
 us to see\n
 ’Tis only the spendour of light\n
 hideth Thee.\n

LORD of all being, throned afar,\n
Thy glory flames from sun and\n
 star;\n
Centre and soul of every sphere,\n
 Yet to each loving heart how\n
 near!\n\n
Sun of our life, Thy quickening ray\n
 Sheds on our path the glow of\n
 day;\n
Star of our hope, Thy softened\n
 light\n
 Cheers the long watches of the\n
 night.\n\n
Our midnight is Thy smile with-\n
 drawn,\n
 Our noontide is Thy gracious\n
 dawn,\n
Our rainbow arch Thy mercy’s\n
 sign;\n
 All, save the clouds of sin, are\n
 Thine.\n\n
Lord of all life, below, above,\n
 Whose light is truth, whose\n
 warmth is love,\n
Before Thy ever-blazing throne\n
 We ask no lustre of our own.\n\n
Grant us Thy truth to make us free,\n
 And kindling hearts that burn\n
 for Thee,\n
Till all Thy living altars claim\n
 One holy light, one heavenly\n
flame.\n

Praise the Lord, for He is kind;\n
For His mercies aye endure,\n
 Ever faithful, ever sure.\n\n
Let us blaze His Name abroad,\n
 For of gods He is the God;\n
For His mercies aye endure,\n
 Ever faithful, ever sure.\n\n
He, with all-commanding might,\n
 Filled the new-made world with\n
 light;\n
For His mercies aye endure,\n
 Ever faithful, ever sure.\n\n
All things living He doth feed;\n
 His full hand supplies their\n
 need;\n
For mercies aye endure,\n
 Ever faithful, ever sure.\n\n
He His chosen race did bless\n
 In the wasteful wilderness:\n
For His mercies aye endure,\n
 Ever faithful, ever sure.\n\n
He hath with a piteous eye\n
 Looked upon our misery:\n
For His mercies aye endure,\n
 Ever faithful, ever sure.\n\n

 Ever faithful, ever sure.\n

In perfect harmony\n
Affirming His glory\n

My God, how wonderful Thou art,\n
Thy majesty how bright!\n
How beautiful Thy mercy-seat,\n
 In depths of burning light!\n\n
 How dread are Thine eternal years,\n
 0 everlasting Lord,\n
By prostrate spirits day and night\n
 Incessantly adored !\n\n
 0 how I fear Thee, living God,\n
 With deepest, tenderest fears,\n
And worship Thee with trembling\n
 hope\n
 And penitential tears !\n\n
 Yet I may love Thee too, 0 Lord,
 Almighty as Thou art,\n
 For Thou hast stooped to ask of me\n
 The love of my poor heart.\n\n
No earthly father loves like Thee;\n
 No mother, e’er so mild,\n
Bears and forbears as Thou hast\n
 done\n
 With me, Thy sinful child.\n\n
 How beautiful, how beautiful\n
 The sight of Thee must be,\n
Thine endless wisdom, boundless\n
 power,\n
And awful purity !\n

O WORSHIP the King all-glorious\n
 above,\n
 O gratefully sing His power and\n
 His love,\n
Our Shield and Defender,\n
 the Ancient of Days,\n
 Pavilioned in splendour, and\n
 girded with praise.\n
O tell of His might, O sing of His\n
 grace,\n
 Whose robe is the light, whose\n
 canopy space.\n
His chariots of wrath the deep\n
 thunder-clouds form,\n
 And dark is His path on the\n
 wings of the storm.\n\n
The earth with its store\n
of wonders untold,\n
 Almighty, Thy power hath\n
 founded of old,\n
Hath stablished it fast \n
by a changeless decree,\n
 And round it hath cast, like a\n
 mantle, the sea.\n\n
Thy bountiful care what tongue\n
 can recite?\n
 It breathes in the air; it shines in\n
 the light;\n
It streams from the hills; it descends\n
 to the plain,\n
And sweetly distils in the dew and\n
 the rain.\n\n
Frail children of dust, and feeble\n
 as frail,\n
In Thee do we trust, nor find\n
 Thee to fail;\n
Thy mercies how tender, how firm\n
 to the end,\n
 Our Maker, Defender, Redeemer, \n
and Friend!\n\n
O measureless Might! ineffable\n
 Love!\n
 While angels delight to hymn\n
 Thee above,\n
The humbler creation, though\n
 feeble their lays,\n
 With true adoration shall lisp to\n
 Thy praise.\n

O LORD of heaven and earth and\n
 sea,\n
To Thee all praise and glory be;\n
 How shall we show our love to\n
 Thee,\n
 Who givest all?\n\n
The golden sunshine, vernal air,\n
Sweet flowers and fruits Thy\n
 love declare;\n
Where harvests ripen, Thou art\n
 there,\n
 Who givest all.\n\n
For peaceful homes and healthful\n
 days,\n
 For all the blessings earth displays\n
We owe Thee thankfulness and\n
 praise,\n
 Who givest all.\n\n
Thou didst not spare Thine only\n
 Son,\n
 But gav’st Him for a world\n
 undone,\n
And freely with that blessèd One\n
 Thou givest all.\n\n
Thou giv’st the Spirit’s blessèd\n
 dower,\n
 Spirit of life and love and\n
 power,
And dost His sevenfold graces\n
 shower\n
 Upon us all.\n\n
For souls redeemed, for sins\n
 forgiven,\n
 For means of grace and hopes\n
 of heaven,\n
Father, all praise to Thee be given,\n
 Who givest all.\n

PRAISE to the Lord, the Almighty,\n
The King of creation;\n
O my soul, praise Him, for He is\n
 thy health and salvation;\n
All ye who hear,\n
Now to His temple draw near,\n
 Joining in glad adoration.\n\n
Praise to the Lord, who o’er all\n
 things so wondrously reigneth,\n
Shieldeth thee gently from harm,\n
 or when fainting sustaineth;\n
Hast thou not seen\n
 How thy heart’s wishes have been\n
Granted in what He ordaineth?\n\n
Praise to the Lord, who doth prosper\n
 thy work and defend thee;\n

 shall daily attend thee;\n

Ever faithful, ever sure.\n\n
Praise Him that He made the sun\n
 Day by day his course to run; –\n

 Shining with her gentle light;\n
For His mercies still endure,\n
 Ever faithful ever sure.\n

 To mature the swelling grain;–\n

To His feet thy tribute bring;\n
 Ransomed, healed, restored,\n

Who like me His praise should sing?\n
 Praise Him! Praise Him!\n
 Praise Him! Praise Him!\n

 To our fathers in distress;\n
Praise Him, still the same for ever,\n
 Slow to chide and swift to bless;\n
 Praise Him! Praise Him!\n

Glorious in His faithfulness.\n\n
Father-like He tends and spares us\n
 Well our feeble frame He\n
 knows\n
In His hands He gently bears us;\n
 Rescues us from all our foes;\n
 Praise Him! Praise Him!\n
 Praise Him! Praise Him!\n
Widely as His mercy flows.\n\n
Frail as summer’s flower we\n

PRAISE to the Holiest in the\n
 height,\n
And in the depth be praise,—\n
 In all His words most wonderful,\n
Most sure in all His ways.\n\n
0 loving wisdom of our God!\n
 When all was sin and shame,\n
A second Adam to the fight\n
 And to the rescue came.\n\n
0 wisest love ! that flesh and blood,\n
 Which did in Adam fail,\n
Should strive afresh against the foe,\n
 Should strive and should prevail ;\n\n
And that a higher gift than grace\n
Should flesh and blood refine,\n
God’s presence, and His very self\n
 And essence all-divine.\n\n
0 generous love! that He who\n
 smote\n
 In Man, for man, the foe,\n
The double agony in Man,\n
 For man, should undergo,\n\n
And in the garden secretly,\n
 And on the Cross on high,\n
Should teach His brethren, and\n
 inspire,\n
 To suffer and to die.\n\n
Praise to the Holiest in the height,\n
 And in the depth be praise,—\n
In all His words most wonderful,\n
 Most sure in all His ways.\n

SONGS of praise the angels sang,\n
Heaven with hallelujahs rang,\n
When creation was begun,\n
 When God spake, and it was done.\n\n
Songs of praise awoke the morn\n
 When the Prince of Peace was\n
 born;\n
Songs of praise arose when He\n
 Captive led captivity.\n\n
Heaven and earth must pass away;\n
 Songs of praise shall crown\n
 that day;\n
God will make new heavens, new\n
 earth;\n
 Songs of praise shall hail their\n
 birth.\n\n
And can man alone be dumb,\n
 Till that glorious kingdom\n
 come?\n
No! the Church delights to raise\n
 Psalms, and hymns, and songs\n
 of praise.\n\n
Saints below, with heart and voice,\n
 Still in songs of praise rejoice,\n
Learning here, by faith and love,\n
 Songs of praise to sing above.\n\n
Borne upon their latest breath,\n
 Songs of praise shall conquer\n
 death;\n
Then, amidst eternal joy,\n
 Songs of praise their powers\n
 employ.\n

TO God be the glory! great things\n
He hath done:\n
So loved He the world that He\n
 gave us His Son;\n
Who yielded His life and atonement for sin,\n
And opened the Life-gate that all\n
 may go in.\n
 Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!\n
 Let the earth hear His voice!\n
 Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!\n
 Let the people rejoice!\n
 Oh, come to the Father,\n
 through Jesus the son;\n
 And give Him the glory–great\n
 things He hath done!\n\n
O perfect redemption, the purchase\n
of blood,\n
To every believer the promise of\n
 God;\n
 The vilest offender who truly\n
 believes,\n
That moment from Jesus a pardon\n
 receives.\n\n
Great things He hath taught us,\n
 great things He hath done:\n
And great our rejoicing through\n
 Jesus the Son;\n
But purer, and higher, and greater\n
 will be\n
Our wonder, our transport,\n
 when Jesus we see.\n

THOUGH troubles assail and\n
dangers affright,\n
Though friends should all fail and\n
 foes all unite,\n
Yet one thing secures us, whatever\n
 betide,\n
The Scripture assures us the Lord\n
 will provide.\n\n
The birds without barn or store\n
 house are fed ;\n
From them let us learn to trust for\n
 our bread;\n
His saints what is fitting shall ne’er\n
 be denied,\n
So long as ’tis written, ‘ The Lord\n
 will provide.’\n\n
His call we obey, like Abram of\n
 old,\n
Not knowing our way, but faith\n
 makes us bold ;\n
 For, though we are strangers, we\n
 have a good guide,\n
And trust, in all dangers, the Lord\n
 will provide.\n\n
No strength of our own or \n
goodness we claim;\n
 Yet, since we have known the\n
 Saviour’s great Name,\n
In this our strong tower for safety\n
 we hide, —\n
The Lord is our power, the Lord\n
 will provide.\n

WHEN all Thy mercies, O my\n
God!\n
My rising soul surveys,\n
 Transported with the view, I’m\n
 lost\n
In wonder, love, and praise.\n\n
O how shall words, with equal\n
 warmth,\n
 The gratitude declare\n
That glows within my ravished\n
 heart!\n
 But Thou canst read it there.\n\n
Unnumbered comforts to my soul\n
 Thy tender care bestowed,\n
Before my infant heart conceived\n
 From whom these comforts\n
flowed.\n\n
 When in the slippery paths of\n
 youth,\n
 With heedless steps I ran,\n
Thine arm, unseen, conveyed me\n
 safe,\n
 And led me up to man.\n\n
When worn with sickness, oft hast\n
 Thou\n
 With health renewed my face;\n
And, when in sins and sorrows\n
 sunk,\n
 Revived my soul with grace.\n\n
Ten thousand thousand precious\n
 gifts\n
 My daily thanks employ;\n
Nor is the least a cheerful heart\n
 That tastes those gifts with joy.\n\n
Through every period of my life\n
 Thy goodness I’ll pursue;\n
And after death, in distant worlds,\n
 The glorious theme renew.\n

NOW thank we all our God,\n
With heart and hands and\n
 voices,\n
Who wondrous things hath done,\n
 In whom His world rejoices,—\n
 Who, from our mothers’ arms,\n
 Hath blessed us on our way\n
With countless gifts of love,\n
 And still is ours to-day.\n\n
0 may this bounteous God\n
 Through all our life be near us,\n
With ever-joyful hearts\n
 And blessèd peace to cheer us,\n
And keep us in His grace,\n
 And guide us when perplexed,\n
And free us from all ills\n
 In this world and the next.\n\n
All praise and thanks to God\n
 The Father now be given,\n
The Son, and Him who reigns\n
 With Them in highest heaven,\n
The one, eternal God,\n
 Whom earth and heaven adore;\n
For thus it was, is now,\n
 And shall be evermore.\n

Wherein Thine honour dwells;\n

 All earthly joy excels.\n\n

 Wherein Thy servants meet;\n
And Thou, 0 Lord, art there,\n
 Thy chosen flock to greet.\n
 We love the word of life,\n
 The word that tells of peace,\n
Of comfort in the strife,\n
 And joys that never cease.\n\n

 For mercies freely given;\n

 The triumph song of heaven!\n\n

 On earth to love Thee more,\n
In heaven to see Thy face,\n
 And with Thy saints adore.\n

Bow down before Him, His glory\n
 proclaim;\n
Gold of obedience and incense\n
 of lowliness\n
Bring, and adore Him; the Lord is\n
 His Name!\n\n
Low at His feet lay thy burden of\n
 carefulness;\n
High on His heart He will bear it\n
 for thee,\n
Comfort thy sorrows, and answer\n
 thy prayerfulness,\n
Guiding thy steps as may best for\n
 thee be.\n\n
Fear not to enter His courts, in the\n
 slenderness\n
Of the poor wealth thou canst\n
 reckon as thine;\n
Truth in its beauty and love in its\n
 tenderness,\n
These are the offerings to lay on\n
 His shrine.\n\n
These, though we bring them in\n
 trembling and fearfulness\n
He will accept for the Name that is\n
 dear,\n
Mornings of joy give for evenings\n
 of tearfulness,\n
Trust for our trembling, and hope\n
 for our fear.\n\n
Worship the Lord in the beauty of\n

 And laud and magnify ?\n\n
O for the living flame\n
 From His own altar brought,\n
To touch our lips, our minds inspire,\n
 And wing to heaven our thought!\n\n
God is our strength and song,\n
 And His salvation ours ;\n
Then be His love in Christ proclaimed\n
 With all our ransomed powers.\n\n

Stand up, and bless His glorious\n

 Henceforth for evermore.\n

SWEETER sounds than music\n
 knows\n
Charm me in Immanuel’s Name;\n
 All her hopes my spirit owes\n
To His birth, and Cross, and shame.\n\n
When He came, the angels sung\n
 ‘Glory be to God on High’\n
Lord, unloose my stammering\n
 tongue;\n
Who should louder sing than I?\n
Did the Lord a man become,\n
That He might the law fulfil,\n
Bleed and suffer in my room, –\n
 And canst thou, my tongue, be\n
 still?\n\n
No! I must my praises bring,\n
 Though they worthless are, and\n
 weak;\n
For, should I refuse to sing,\n
 Sure the very stones would speak.\n\n
O my Saviour, Shield, and Sun,\n
 Shepherd, Brother, Husband,\n
 Friend –\n
Every precious name in one –\n
 I will love Thee without end.\n

 King of glory, God of grace!\n\n
Happy birds that sing and fly\n
 Round Thy altars, 0 Most High!\n
Happier souls that find a rest\n
 In a heavenly Father’s breast!\n
Like the wandering dove that\n
 found\n
 No repose on earth around,\n
 They can to their ark repair,\n
 And enjoy it ever there.\n\n
Happy souls! their praises flow\n
 Even in this vale of woe;\n
Waters in the desert rise,\n
 Manna feeds them from the\n
 skies;\n
On they go from strength to\n
 strength,\n
 Till they reach Thy throne at\n
 length,\n
At Thy feet adoring fall,\n
 Who hast led them safe\n
 through all.\n\n
Lord, be mine this prize to win:\n
 Guide me through a world of\n
 sin;\n
Keep me by Thy saving grace;\n
 Give me at Thy side a place.\n
Sun and shield alike Thou art;\n
 Guide and guard my erring\n
 heart.\n
 Grace and glory flow from Thee;\n
 Shower, 0 shower them. Lord,\n

 Thy very Name is music\n
 To ear, and heart, and mind.\n

 It drew our harder manhood\n
 With cords of mighty love.\n\n
How oft to sure destruction\n
 Our feet had gone astray,\n
Hadst Thou not, patient Shepherd,\n
 Been Guardian of our way.\n
How oft, in darkness fallen,\n
 And wounded sore by sin,\n
Thy hand has gently raised us,\n
 And healing balm poured in.\n\n
O Shepherd good! we follow\n
 Wherever Thou wilt lead:\n
 No matter where the pasture,\n
 With Thee at hand to feed.\n
 Thy voice, in life so mighty,\n
 In death shall make us bold :\n

That youth may love, and age adore.\n\n
O way, through whom our souls\n
 draw near\n
 To yon eternal home of peace,\n
Where perfect love shall cast out\n
 fear.\n
 And earth’s vain toil and \n
wandering cease,\n
In strength or weakness may we see\n
Our heavenward path, O Lord,\n
 through Thee.\n\n
O Truth, before whose shrine we\n
 bow,\n
 Thou priceless pearl for all who\n
 seek,\n
To Thee our earliest strength we\n
 vow;\n
 Thy love will bless the pure and\n
 meek;\n
When dreams or mists beguile our\n
 sight,\n
 Turn Thou our darkness into\n
 light.\n\n

 To slake the thirst of those that\n
 faint,\n
Thy power to bless, what seraph\n

In earth’s last hour of fleeting\n
 breath,\n
