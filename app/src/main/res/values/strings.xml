        GOD, who made the earth,\n
The air, the sky, the sea,\n
Who gave the light its birth,\n
 Careth for me.\n
            \n
2 God, who made the grass,\n
The flower, the fruit, the tree,\n
The day and night to pass,\n
 Careth for me.\n
            \n
3 God, who made the sun,\n
 The moon, the stars, is He\n
Who, when life’s clouds come on,\n
 Careth for me.\n
            \n
4 God, who made all things\n
 On earth, in air, in sea,\n
Who changing seasons brings\n
 Careth for me.\n
            \n
5 God, who sent His Son\n
 To die on Calvary,\n
He, if I lean on Him,\n
 Will care for me.\n
            \n
6 When in heaven’s bright land\n
 I all His loved ones see,\n
I’ll sing with that blest band,\n
 ‘God cared for me.’\n

        O TRINITY, O blessèd light,\n
O unity, most principal,\n
The fiery sun now leaves our sight:\n
 Cause in our hearts Thy beams\n
 to fall.\n
            \n
2 Let us with songs of praise divine\n
 At morn and evening Thee\n
 implore,\n
And let our glory, bowed to Thine,\n
 Thee glorify for evermore.\n
            \n
3 To God the Father, glory great,\n
 And glory to His only son,\n
And to the Holy paraclete,\n
 Both now and still while ages\n
 run. Amen.\n
