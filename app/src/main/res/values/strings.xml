        GOD, who made the earth,\n
The air, the sky, the sea,\n
Who gave the light its birth,\n
 Careth for me.\n
            \n
God, who made the grass,\n
The flower, the fruit, the tree,\n
The day and night to pass,\n
 Careth for me.\n

God, who made the sun,\n
            The moon, the stars, is He\n
Who, when life’s clouds come on,\n
 Careth for me.\n

God, who made all things\n
 On earth, in air, in sea,\n
Who changing seasons brings\n
 Careth for me.\n

God, who sent His Son\n
 To die on Calvary,\n
He, if I lean on Him,\n
 Will care for me.\n

        O TRINITY, O blessèd light,\n
O unity, most principal,\n
The fiery sun now leaves our\n
            sight: Cause in our hearts\n
            Thy beams to fall.\n

And let our glory, bowed to Thine,\n
 Thee glorify for evermore.\n

To God the Father, glory great,\n
And glory to His only son,\n
And to the Holy paraclete,\n
Both now and still while ages\n
run. Amen.\n

O God;\n
Thy sovereign power we sound\n
 abroad;\n
All nations bow before Thy throne\n
 And Thee the great Jehovah own.\n

Eternal praise to Thee is given.\n

            ROUND the Lord in glory seated,\n
Cherubim and seraphim\n
Filled His temple, and repeated\n
 Each to each the alternate hymn:\n
‘Lord, Thy glory fills the heaven;\n
 Earth is with its fulness stored;\n
Unto Thee be glory given,\n
 Holy, holy, holy Lord.’\n\n
Heaven is still with glory ringing,\n
 Earth takes up the angels’ cry,\n
‘Holy, holy, holy,’ singing,\n
 ‘Lord of hosts, the Lord most\n
 high.\n
Lord, Thy glory fills the heaven;\n
 Earth is with its fulness stored;\n
Unto Thee be glory given,\n
 Holy, holy, holy Lord.’\n\n
With His seraph train before Him,\n
 With His holy Church below,\n
Thus conspire we to adore Him,\n
Bid we thus our anthem flow;\n
‘Lord, Thy glory fills the heaven;\n
 Earth is with its fulness stored;\n
Unto Thee be glory given,\n
 Holy, holy, holy Lord.’\n

A GLADSOME hymn of praise\n
we sing\n
 And thankfully we gather\n
To bless the love of God above,\n
 Our everlasting Father.\n\n
In Him rejoice with heart and voice,\n
 Whose glory fadeth never,\n
Whose providence is our defence,\n
 Who lives and loves for ever.\n\n
Full in His sight His children stand,\n
 By His strong arm defended,\n
 And He whose wisdom guides the\n
 World\n
 Our footsteps hath attended.\n\n
For nothing falls unknown to Him,\n
 Or care or joy or sorrow,\n
And He whose mercy ruled the past\n
 Will be our stay to-morrow.\n\n
Then praise the Lord with one\n
 accord,\n
 To His great Name give glory,\n
 And of His never-changing love\n
 Repeat the wondrous story.\n

 light.\n\n

 day\n

 thee grow,\n

ANGEL voices, ever singing\n
Round Thy throne of light,\n
Angel harps, forever ringing,\n
 Rest not day nor night;\n
Thousands only live to bless Thee,\n
 And confess Thee\n
Lord of might.\n\n
Yea, we know that Thou rejoicest\n
 O’er each work of Thine;\n
Thou didst ears and hands and\n
 voices\n
 For Thy praise design;\n
Craftsman’s art and music’s measure\n
 For Thy pleasure\n
All combine.\n\n
In Thy house, great God, we offer\n
 Of Thine own to Thee,\n
And for Thine acceptance proffer,\n
 All unworthily,\n
Hearts and minds and hands and\n
 voices,\n
 In our choicest Psalmody.\n\n
Honour, glory, might, and merit\n
 Thine shall ever be,\n
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit\n
 Blessèd Trinity.\n
Of the best that thou hast given,\n
 Earth and heaven\n
Render Thee.\n

BEAUTIFUL the fields beyond the\n
river!\n
Glorious the thousands gathered\n
 there!\n
 But who in heav’n, so full of\n
grace and glory Who with \n
Him, our Saviour, can compare? …\n
 Oh, He is the chief among ten\n
thousand! . . .\n
 Roll His praise in joyful waves\n
 along! . . .\n
For “altogether, altogether lovely!”\n
 Shall for ever be our happy song! . . .\n\n
Altogether, altogether lovely!\n
 He is calling tenderly to thee;\n
My soul, why not accept His great\n
 salvation,\n
 Offered now so rich, so full, so\n
 free?\n\n
Altogether, altogether lovely!\n
 Hear His voice – how tender\n
 still the call:\n
 “Come, come, ye weary ones and\n
 heavy-laden,\n
 Come to Me, and let your\n
 burdens fall!” . . .\n

GOD moves in a mysterious way,\n
 His wonders to perform ;\n
He plants His footsteps in the sea,\n
 And rides upon the storm.\n\n
Deep in unfathomable mines\n
 Of never-failing skill\n
He treasures up His bright designs,\n
 And works His sovereign will.\n\n
Ye fearful saints, fresh courage\n
 take;\n
 The clouds ye so much dread\n
Are big with mercy, and shall break\n
 In blessings on your head.\n\n
Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,\n
 But trust Him for His grace ;\n
Behind a frowning providence\n
 He hides a smiling face.\n\n
His purposes will ripen fast,\n
 Unfolding every hour;\n
The bud may have a bitter taste,\n
 But sweet will be the flower.\n
Blind unbelief is sure to err,\n
 And scan His work in vain ;\n
God is His own interpreter,\n
 And He will make it plain.\n

 There is no shadow of turning\n
 with Thee;\n
\n
 Thou changest not, Thy compas-\n
 sions, they fail not;\n
 As Thou hast been Thou for ever\n
 wilt be:\n
“Great is Thy faithfulness! Great is Thy\n
 faithfulness!”\n
 Morning by morning new mercies I see;\n
All I have needed Thy hand has provided.-\n
“Great is Thy faithfulness,” Lord, unto me.\n\n
 Summer and winter, and spring-\n
 time and harvest,\n
 Sun, moon and stars in their\n
 courses above,\n
Join with all nature in manifold\n
 witness\n
 To Thy great faithfulness,\n
 mercy and love:\n\n
Pardon for sin and a peace that\n
 endureth,\n
 Thy own dear presence to cheer\n
 and to guide;\n
Strength for today and bright hope\n
 for tomorrow,\n
 Blessings all mine, with ten\n
 thousand beside!\n

IMMORTAL, invisible, God only\n
 wise,\n
In light inaccessible hid from our eyes\n
 Most blessèd, most glorious,\n
 the Ancient of Days,\n
Almighty, victorious, Thy great\n
 Name we praise.\n\n
Unresting, unhasting, and silent as\n
 light,\n
 Nor wanting, nor wasting,\n
 Thou rulest in might;\n
Thy justice like mountains high\n
 soaring above\n
 Thy clouds which are fountains\n
 of goodness and love.\n\n
To all, life Thou givest – to both\n
 great and small;\n
 In all life Thou livest, the true\n
 life of all;\n
We blossom and flourish as leaves\n
 on the tree,\n
 And wither and perish – but\n
 nought changeth Thee.\n\n
Great Father of Glory, pure Father\n
 of Light,\n
 Thine angels adore Thee, all\n
 veiling their sight;\n
All laud we would render: O help\n
 us to see\n
 ’Tis only the spendour of light\n
 hideth Thee.\n

LORD of all being, throned afar,\n
Thy glory flames from sun and\n
 star;\n
Centre and soul of every sphere,\n
 Yet to each loving heart how\n
 near!\n\n
Sun of our life, Thy quickening ray\n
 Sheds on our path the glow of\n
 day;\n
Star of our hope, Thy softened\n
 light\n
 Cheers the long watches of the\n
 night.\n\n
Our midnight is Thy smile with-\n
 drawn,\n
 Our noontide is Thy gracious\n
 dawn,\n
Our rainbow arch Thy mercy’s\n
 sign;\n
 All, save the clouds of sin, are\n
 Thine.\n\n
Lord of all life, below, above,\n
 Whose light is truth, whose\n
 warmth is love,\n
Before Thy ever-blazing throne\n
 We ask no lustre of our own.\n\n
Grant us Thy truth to make us free,\n
 And kindling hearts that burn\n
 for Thee,\n
Till all Thy living altars claim\n
 One holy light, one heavenly\n
flame.\n

For His mercies aye endure,\n
 Ever faithful, ever sure.\n\n

For His mercies aye endure,\n
 Ever faithful, ever sure.\n\n
All things living He doth feed;\n
 His full hand supplies their\n
 need;\n
For mercies aye endure,\n
 Ever faithful, ever sure.\n\n
He His chosen race did bless\n
 In the wasteful wilderness:\n
For His mercies aye endure,\n
 Ever faithful, ever sure.\n\n
He hath with a piteous eye\n
 Looked upon our misery:\n

 Ever faithful, ever sure.\n\n

My God, how wonderful Thou art,\n
Thy majesty how bright!\n
How beautiful Thy mercy-seat,\n
 In depths of burning light!\n\n
 How dread are Thine eternal years,\n
 0 everlasting Lord,\n
By prostrate spirits day and night\n
 Incessantly adored !\n\n
 0 how I fear Thee, living God,\n
 With deepest, tenderest fears,\n
And worship Thee with trembling\n
 hope\n
 And penitential tears !\n\n
 Yet I may love Thee too, 0 Lord,
 Almighty as Thou art,\n
 For Thou hast stooped to ask of me\n
 The love of my poor heart.\n\n
No earthly father loves like Thee;\n
 No mother, e’er so mild,\n
Bears and forbears as Thou hast\n
 done\n
 With me, Thy sinful child.\n\n
 How beautiful, how beautiful\n
 The sight of Thee must be,\n
Thine endless wisdom, boundless\n
 power,\n
And awful purity !\n

O WORSHIP the King all-glorious\n
 above,\n
 O gratefully sing His power and\n
 His love,\n
Our Shield and Defender,\n
 the Ancient of Days,\n
 Pavilioned in splendour, and\n
 girded with praise.\n
O tell of His might, O sing of His\n
 grace,\n
 Whose robe is the light, whose\n
 canopy space.\n
His chariots of wrath the deep\n
 thunder-clouds form,\n
 And dark is His path on the\n
 wings of the storm.\n\n
The earth with its store\n
of wonders untold,\n
 Almighty, Thy power hath\n
 founded of old,\n
Hath stablished it fast \n
by a changeless decree,\n
 And round it hath cast, like a\n
 mantle, the sea.\n\n
Thy bountiful care what tongue\n
 can recite?\n
 It breathes in the air; it shines in\n
 the light;\n
It streams from the hills; it descends\n
 to the plain,\n
And sweetly distils in the dew and\n
 the rain.\n\n
Frail children of dust, and feeble\n
 as frail,\n
In Thee do we trust, nor find\n
 Thee to fail;\n
Thy mercies how tender, how firm\n
 to the end,\n
 Our Maker, Defender, Redeemer, \n
and Friend!\n\n
O measureless Might! ineffable\n
 Love!\n
 While angels delight to hymn\n
 Thee above,\n
The humbler creation, though\n
 feeble their lays,\n
 With true adoration shall lisp to\n
 Thy praise.\n

O LORD of heaven and earth and\n
 sea,\n
To Thee all praise and glory be;\n
 How shall we show our love to\n
 Thee,\n
 Who givest all?\n\n
The golden sunshine, vernal air,\n
Sweet flowers and fruits Thy\n
 love declare;\n
Where harvests ripen, Thou art\n
 there,\n
 Who givest all.\n\n
For peaceful homes and healthful\n
 days,\n
 For all the blessings earth displays\n
We owe Thee thankfulness and\n
 praise,\n
 Who givest all.\n\n
Thou didst not spare Thine only\n
 Son,\n
 But gav’st Him for a world\n
 undone,\n
And freely with that blessèd One\n
 Thou givest all.\n\n
Thou giv’st the Spirit’s blessèd\n
 dower,\n
 Spirit of life and love and\n
 power,
And dost His sevenfold graces\n
 shower\n
 Upon us all.\n\n
For souls redeemed, for sins\n
 forgiven,\n
 For means of grace and hopes\n
 of heaven,\n
Father, all praise to Thee be given,\n
 Who givest all.\n
